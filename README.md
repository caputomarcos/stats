# What is this?

It's a collection of iPython notebooks I created while taking a stats course. The professor taught the class using Minitab and SAS; however, I wanted to learn how to do the assignments in python. I knew this would be to my advantage later on when I started learning machine learning with `scikit-learn`. Topics covered here:

- Linear regression with one prdictor variable
- Regression and correlation analysis
- Multiple regression
- Quantitative and qualitative predictors
- Model selection, validation and diagnostics
- ANOVA diagnostics

I think I'll abstain from mentioning the specific university and textbook so as to discourage folks from simply copying my work for their own classes.
