## What is this?

It's a collection of iPython notebooks I created while taking a stats course. The professor taught the class using Minitab and SAS; however, I wanted to learn how to do the assignments in python. I knew this would be to my advantage later on when I started learning machine learning with `scikit-learn`. 

Most of the problems come from _Applied Linear Statistical Models, Fifth Edition_ by Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, and Li (2005). 


## Topics covered 

- Linear regression with one predictor variable
- Regression and correlation analysis
- Multiple regression
- Quantitative and qualitative predictors
- Model selection, validation and diagnostics
- ANOVA diagnostics


## Python packages used

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- statsmodels
- sklearn
- seaborn

I also used Minitab and SAS for some work I didn't have time to figure out how to do in python.
